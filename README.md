# Quiztopia by Team 11D

## Application Description

Quiztopia is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to provide users with an engaging trivia experience. The platform allows users to explore a wide range of quizzes categorized by topics and difficulty levels. Users can create accounts, participate in quizzes, and track their progress over time. 

## Population Script:
The `population_script.py` script automates the setup of the Quiztopia app by installing required packages, resetting the database, creating a superuser, and populating the app with sample users, quizzes, questions, and answers. It fetches trivia data from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com) and organizes it into various categories and difficulties for testing and development purposes.
