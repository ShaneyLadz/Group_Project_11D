## TO DO: COMPLETE FOR REST OF APP

## Population Script Description:
The `population_script.py` script automates the setup of the Quiztopia app by installing required packages, resetting the database, creating a superuser, and populating the app with sample users, quizzes, questions, and answers. It fetches trivia data from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com) and organizes it into various categories and difficulties for testing and development purposes.
